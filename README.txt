Hello! Thanks for looking at my converter. I made this after the Java conver
I thought Python may be more functional than Java, but it still has the normal
issues with accuracy.

This converter splits the input into an integral portion and a fractional portion.
The integral portion has accuracy up to and including 21 digits.
The fractional portion currently has variable accuracy. It may be accurate up to
8 or 20 digits. I am currently working on making this a fixed accuracy, but it will
never be fully accurate. Most fractional base conversions end up with repeating numbers
infinitely. That's the essence of conversion though.
